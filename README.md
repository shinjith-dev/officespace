# The Complete Company Landing Page - Holistic Webdev Challenge

*This is a submission for [Frontend Challenge: Office Edition sponsored by Axero, Holistic Webdev: Office Space](https://dev.to/challenges/frontend/axero)*

## What I Built

<!-- Tell us about your intranet layout and what you were looking to achieve. -->

As an employee, I've often wondered if there was a single website solution where I could view everything at a glance to start the day. Despite the fact that there are planning, product development tools, and dashboards, all of the information is spread across multiple websites. 

I was able to design a simple prototype of a company landing page that summarizes all data for a quick glance throughout the day. Please access the live URL and view the details.

## Demo

<!-- Show us your project! Share a public link to your code and embed your CodePen (or similar editor) directly into this post (see the FAQ section from the challenge page). -->

## Journey

<!-- Tell us about your process, what you learned, any choices you are particularly proud of, etc. -->

As I previously stated, my intention was to put all necessary data on the home page.  It was difficult to design such a page. After looking for inspiration and incorporating UI elements from existing established solutions, I was able to create a minimal solution, which still requires a lot of work.

This design is heavily reliant on [**@shadcn-ui**](https://github.com/shadcn-ui) and blocks produced from it via various websites. Also the color theme is adapted from **[@catpuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin) color palette**.

## Conclusion

The UI is currently immature, but the main goal is to consolidate all critical information on the home page. If you believe there is something missing, please leave a comment. Please show your support by liking this post. Many thanks.
